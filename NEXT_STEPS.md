- [ ] **Search & Filtering**: Design global search functionality
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Identify potential performance bottlenecks

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality

- Maintain TypeScript strict mode
- Follow established component patterns
- Use the centralized theme colors from `src/theme/colors.ts`
- Leverage pre-commit hooks for consistent code quality
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Use Zustand for state management patterns

### Backend Best Practices

- Use Supabase RLS for data security
- Implement proper error handling for network requests
- Cache data locally with AsyncStorage for offline support
- Use TypeScript types that match database schema

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for utility functions and stores
- Component testing for UI elements
- Integration testing for Supabase operations
- Manual testing on both iOS and Android

### Documentation

- Update README.md with new features
- Maintain inline code documentation
- Update this NEXT_STEPS.md as progress is made
- Document database schema and API patterns

## Success Metrics

### Phase 2 Completion Criteria

- [ ] Supabase database schema implemented and tested
- [ ] Zustand stores integrated with Supabase backend
- [ ] Complete trip creation flow functional
- [ ] Expense tracking with trip/location context working
- [ ] Journal entries with photo attachments implemented
- [ ] User authentication working
- [ ] Basic shared component library established

### Quality Gates

- [ ] All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- [ ] No console errors in development
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks passing (linting/formatting)
- [ ] Responsive design working on various screen sizes
- [ ] Performance acceptable on target devices
- [ ] Offline functionality working with sync

## Notes

- Focus on backend integration before complex UI features
- Maintain consistency with established theme colors
- Test Supabase operations thoroughly before building UI
- Consider user feedback early and often
- Regular testing on physical devices recommended

## Environment Setup Reminder

**Important**: Create a `.env` file in your project root with:

```
SUPABASE_URL=https://cmwtvyzdnvbkznoqaufw.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImNtd3R2eXpkbnZia3pub3FhdWZ3Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDgxNDAzNTAsImV4cCI6MjA2MzcxNjM1MH0.3UgmBGlqZsXgxHqvYSTfsuH8LaYMkVUEc5WyfcArWCs
