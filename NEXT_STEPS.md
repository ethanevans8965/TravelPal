## Development Guidelines

### Current Architecture

- **State Management**: Hybrid approach (Zustand + React Context)
- **Navigation**: Expo Router with tab-based navigation
- **Styling**: StyleSheet with consistent design system
- **Data Persistence**: AsyncStorage with Zustand middleware
- **Performance**: Optimized with useMemo and useCallback for expensive operations

### Code Standards

- TypeScript for all new code with strict type checking
- Consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)
- Modular component structure with clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling and edge case management
- Performance-first approach with proper memoization

### Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading for large data sets and complex components
- Memoization for expensive calculations and filtering operations
- Optimized re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Efficient data structures for filtering and searching
- Virtualized lists for large expense collections (future consideration)

**Next Recommended Task**: Start with Task 4.4 (Financial Reports & Analytics) as it completes the core Finances hub functionality and provides valuable insights to users based on the comprehensive expense and budget data we now have.
