## Development Guidelines

### Current Architecture

- **State Management**: Hybrid approach (Zustand + React Context)
- **Navigation**: Expo Router with tab-based navigation
- **Styling**: StyleSheet with consistent design system
- **Data Persistence**: AsyncStorage with Zustand middleware
- **Performance**: Optimized with useMemo and useCallback for expensive operations
- **Charts**: react-native-chart-kit with custom reusable components

### Code Standards

- TypeScript for all new code with strict type checking
- Consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)
- Modular component structure with clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling and edge case management
- Performance-first approach with proper memoization
- Reusable component design for charts and reports

### Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading for chart components and complex visualizations
- Memoization for expensive chart data calculations
- Optimized re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Efficient data structures for chart data processing
- Virtualized lists for large datasets (implemented where needed)

**Next Recommended Task**: Start with Enhanced Expense Management Features as it builds on the comprehensive expense system we've created and provides immediate user value for expense operations and management.
