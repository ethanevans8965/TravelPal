## Development Guidelines

### Current Architecture

- **State Management**: Hybrid approach (Zustand + React Context)
- **Navigation**: Expo Router with tab-based navigation
- **Styling**: StyleSheet with consistent design system
- **Data Persistence**: AsyncStorage with Zustand middleware

### Code Standards

- TypeScript for all new code
- Consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)
- Modular component structure with clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling and edge case management

### Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading for large data sets
- Memoization for expensive calculations
- Optimized re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Efficient data structures for filtering and searching

**Next Recommended Task**: Start with Task 4.3 (All Expenses Tab Implementation) as it builds directly on the budget overview work and provides immediate user value for expense management.
