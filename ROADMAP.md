- **âœ… AsyncStorage Persistence**: Automatic data persistence with Zustand middleware

**Expense Tracking Store:**

- **âœ… Expense Store Implementation**: Full CRUD operations with trip/location linking
- **âœ… Utility Functions**: getExpensesByTripId, getExpensesByLocationId
- **âœ… Data Relationships**: Proper linking to trips and locations
- **âœ… Persistence**: AsyncStorage integration with automatic sync

**Currency Conversion System:**

- **âœ… Live Exchange Rates**: Integration with exchangerate-api.com
- **âœ… Caching System**: 24-hour TTL with AsyncStorage
- **âœ… Offline Support**: Graceful fallback with expired cache handling
- **âœ… Modern UI**: Currency converter with swap functionality and loading states
- **âœ… Error Handling**: Network connectivity detection and user feedback

### ðŸš§ Currently In Development:

**Enhanced Trip Management:**

- **ðŸš§ Floating Plus FAB**: Trip creation workflow via floating action button
- **ðŸ“‹ Location Selection**: Integration during trip creation
- **ðŸ“‹ Budget Planning**: Total/daily, emergency fund, pre-trip costs linked to expense system
- **ðŸ“‹ Trip Dashboard**: Views showing associated expenses and journal entries

**Journal System Implementation:**

- **ðŸ“‹ Journal Store**: Zustand store for journal entries with persistence
- **ðŸ“‹ Location-Aware Entries**: Link entries to trips and tag with locations
- **ðŸ“‹ Photo Attachments**: Integration with device camera and storage
- **ðŸ“‹ Tag Organization**: System for organizing entries

**Location Management:**

- **ðŸ“‹ Location Store**: Zustand store for geographical location management
- **ðŸ“‹ Country Data Integration**: Enhanced location selection with country data

### ðŸ“‹ Planned for Phase 2:

**Feature Integration Preparation:**

- **ðŸ“‹ Shared Components**: Reusable UI component library
- **ðŸ“‹ Navigation Enhancement**: Deep linking between related entities
- **ðŸ“‹ Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and error handling

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: Feature Integration & UX Refinement (Planned)

**Objective**: Ensure seamless interaction between features and improve overall usability.

**Planned Features:**

- **Cross-Feature Navigation**: Intuitive navigation between related trips, expenses, journal entries, and locations
- **Unified Dashboards**: Trip dashboards showing budget, expenses, and relevant journal entries
- **Global Search & Filtering**: Search across all features (expenses by country, journal entries by tag)
- **UI/UX Polish**: Refined interface elements and workflows
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized rendering and data loading

**Technical Improvements:**

- **Component Library**: Standardized UI components with consistent theming
- **Animation System**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and accessibility improvements
- **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 4: Advanced Features & Future Enhancements (Planned)

**Objective**: Introduce advanced functionalities and prepare for future growth.

**Advanced Features:**

- **Data Visualization**: Charts, maps, and visual elements for travel data insights
- **Enhanced Offline Support**: Full offline functionality with intelligent sync
- **Data Import/Export**: Import existing travel data or export TravelPal data
- **Notifications & Reminders**: Intelligent reminders for trips and budget checkpoints
- **Social/Sharing Features**: Trip sharing and collaborative planning (with privacy controls)

**Technical Enhancements:**

- **Performance Monitoring**: Analytics and performance tracking
- **Security Hardening**: Enhanced data protection and privacy features
- **Scalability**: Optimization for large datasets and multiple trips
- **Platform Expansion**: Potential web app or desktop companion

## Current Development Status

### Recently Completed (Last Sprint):

- âœ… Trip Store with full CRUD operations and persistence
- âœ… Expense Store with trip/location linking
- âœ… Currency converter with caching and offline support
- âœ… Removed test components in favor of FAB workflow
- âœ… Enhanced project documentation

### Next Sprint Priorities:

1. **Journal Store Implementation** (High Priority)
2. **Location Store Implementation** (High Priority)
3. **Floating Plus FAB** (Medium Priority)
4. **Trip Creation Flow** (Medium Priority)

### Success Metrics:

**Phase 2 Completion Criteria:**

- [ ] Journal Store implemented with photo attachments
- [ ] Location Store with country data integration
- [ ] Floating Plus FAB with trip creation workflow
- [ ] All stores properly coordinated and tested
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and offline support

## Technical Architecture Notes

### State Management Pattern:

- **Zustand Stores**: Core data (trips, expenses, journal, locations)
- **React Context**: UI state (theme, navigation, preferences)
- **AsyncStorage**: Persistence layer with automatic sync
- **Store Coordination**: Cross-store operations for data consistency

### Development Principles:

- **Offline-First**: All core functionality works without internet
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering and data operations
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and modular architecture

## Future Considerations

### Potential Integrations:

- **Supabase Backend**: For cloud sync and multi-device support
- **Maps Integration**: For location services and route planning
- **Camera Integration**: For receipt and photo capture
- **Calendar Integration**: For trip scheduling and reminders

### Scalability Planning:

- **Data Migration**: Strategies for schema updates
- **Performance**: Optimization for large datasets
- **Platform Support**: Cross-platform compatibility
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support
