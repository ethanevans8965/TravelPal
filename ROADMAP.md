# TravelPal Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned phases for the development and enhancement of the TravelPal application. Our primary goal is to create a cohesive and integrated user experience.

## Phase 1: Enhanced Data Model & State Management (Complete)

**Objective**: Establish a solid foundation for integrated features.

*   **Introduced `Location` Interface**: Defined a new data type for geographical locations.
*   **Established Entity Relationships**: Created clear links between `Trip`, `Expense`, `JournalEntry`, and `Location` entities using IDs.
*   **Updated `AppContext`**: Enhanced `app/context.tsx` to manage the new state structure, including CRUD operations for all entities and utility functions for retrieving related data.
*   **Data Model Documentation**: Updated `app/types.ts` with the new and revised interfaces.
*   **Initial Documentation**: Updated `README.md` to reflect these foundational changes.

## Phase 2: Feature Development with Integration Points (In Progress)

**Objective**: Build out core features with a focus on how they connect and interact.

*   **Enhanced Trip Management**:
    *   Develop flows for creating, viewing, and editing trips.
    *   Incorporate `Location` selection (for destination) during trip creation.
    *   Integrate budget planning (total/daily, emergency fund, pre-trip costs) directly linked to the expense system.
    *   Design trip-centric views that can later display associated expenses and journal entries.
*   **Contextual Expense Tracking**:
    *   Update expense logging to link each expense to a specific `Trip` and optionally a `Location`.
    *   Ensure expense categorization aligns with trip budget categories.
    *   Implement currency handling based on trip location or user settings.
    *   Add functionality for attaching receipt photos and tags.
*   **Location-Aware Travel Journal**:
    *   Enhance journal entry creation to link entries to a `Trip` and tag them with a `Location`.
    *   Allow photo attachments to journal entries.
    *   Explore linking journal entries to related expenses.
    *   Implement organization via tags.

## Phase 3: Feature Integration & UX Refinement

**Objective**: Ensure seamless interaction between features and improve overall usability.

*   **Cross-Feature Navigation**: Implement intuitive navigation between related trips, expenses, journal entries, and locations.
*   **Unified Dashboards/Views**: Create views that aggregate data (e.g., a trip dashboard showing its budget, expenses, and relevant journal entries).
*   **Shared Components & Utilities**: Develop and utilize a library of shared UI components and utility functions for consistency and efficiency.
*   **Global Search & Filtering**: Implement capabilities to search and filter data across all features (e.g., find all expenses for a specific country, or all journal entries tagged "beach").
*   **UI/UX Polish**: Refine user interface elements and workflows based on usability best practices.

## Phase 4: Advanced Features & Future Enhancements

**Objective**: Introduce advanced functionalities and prepare for future growth.

*   **Data Visualization**: Incorporate charts, maps, and other visual elements to present travel data in insightful ways.
*   **Offline Support**: Enable core functionalities to work offline with data synchronization when connectivity is restored.
*   **Data Import/Export**: Allow users to import existing travel data or export their TravelPal data.
*   **Notifications & Reminders**: Add intelligent reminders for upcoming trips, budget checkpoints, etc.
*   **Social/Sharing Features (Optional)**: Explore possibilities for trip sharing, collaborative planning, or sharing journal entries (with privacy controls).
*   **Accessibility Improvements**: Ensure the app is accessible to a wider range of users.
*   **Performance Optimization**: Continuously monitor and optimize app performance.
