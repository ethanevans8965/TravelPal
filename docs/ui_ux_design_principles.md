# TravelPal UI/UX Design Principles

## Design Philosophy

TravelPal aims to be a _travel companion_, not just a budget tool. The design should reflect this by being:

- **Approachable**: Friendly, non-intimidating, even for users unfamiliar with budgeting
- **Efficient**: Allow quick entry and retrieval of information, especially during travel
- **Supportive**: Provide guidance without being judgmental about spending
- **Trustworthy**: Present financial information clearly and accurately

## User Experience Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with the most important information and actions, with details available on demand.
2. **Guided Interaction**: Lead users through complex processes step-by-step.
3. **Contextual Help**: Provide explanations and tips where users might need them.
4. **Forgiving Design**: Make it easy to undo actions and correct mistakes.
5. **Responsive Feedback**: Confirm user actions and show progress for longer operations.

## Visual Design Elements

### Color Palette

- **Primary Color**: A vibrant, travel-inspired color (e.g., teal blue #057B8C) for the main brand identity
- **Secondary Color**: A complementary color (e.g., coral #F27A5E) for accents and calls-to-action
- **Neutral Colors**: Light grays for backgrounds, darker grays for text
- **Functional Colors**: Green for positive indicators (under budget), amber for warnings, red for alerts (over budget)

### Typography

- **Primary Font**: A clean, modern, highly readable sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Roboto)
- **Text Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, subheadings, body text, and captions
- **Number Display**: Monospaced for financial figures to aid readability and comparison

### UI Components

- **Cards**: To contain related information about trips, budgets, or expense groupings
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual representations of budget usage and spending trends
- **Form Elements**: Simplified, streamlined inputs with clear validation
- **Lists**: For displaying transactions and historical data in a scannable format

## Navigation Structure

### Primary Navigation (3-Tab Structure) ✅

- **Home**: Dashboard with currency converter, trip snapshot, budget overview, recent expenses, and quick actions
- **Trips**: Comprehensive trip management with list view, detailed trip cards, and trip creation
- **Finances**: Consolidated financial hub with sub-navigation for budgets, expenses, and reports

### Sub-Navigation

#### Finances Tab Sub-Navigation ✅

- **Budgets**: Overall budget planning and trip-specific budget management
- **All Expenses**: Global expense list with filtering and categorization capabilities
- **Reports**: Financial analytics, spending patterns, and budget performance insights

#### Trip Detail Navigation ✅

When a user selects a specific trip:

- **Trip Overview**: Comprehensive trip information with dates, status, and budget summary
- **Trip Budget**: Detailed budget categories and allocation for the trip
- **Trip Expenses**: List of recorded expenses specific to this trip
- **Trip Settings**: Trip-specific preferences and management options

### Global Actions ✅

#### Floating Action Button (FAB)

Universal access to core actions from any screen:

- **Add Expense**: Quick expense entry with trip selection
- **Add Trip**: Launch trip creation workflow
- **Add Budget Item**: Create new budget plans or categories

## Interaction Patterns

### Primary Workflows ✅

1. **Creating a New Trip**:

   - Home Dashboard → Quick Action "Plan New Trip" OR Trips Tab → "+" Button OR Global FAB → "Add Trip"
   - Enter basic info → Select budgeting scenario → Create budget → Review/Confirm

2. **Recording an Expense**:

   - Home Dashboard → Quick Action "Add Expense" OR Global FAB → "Add Expense" OR Finances Tab → All Expenses
   - Select trip → Enter expense details → Categorize → Save → View updated totals

3. **Checking Budget Status**:

   - Home Dashboard → Budget Overview Widget OR Trips Tab → Select Trip → Trip Details
   - View overview → Explore category details if needed

4. **Viewing Trip Details**:

   - Home Dashboard → Current Trip Snapshot OR Trips Tab → Tap Trip Card
   - View comprehensive trip information → Navigate to specific sections as needed

5. **Managing Finances**:
   - Finances Tab → Select sub-tab (Budgets/All Expenses/Reports)
   - Filter and analyze financial data → Take actions as needed

### Mobile Considerations ✅

- **3-Tab Bottom Navigation**: Streamlined navigation with Home, Trips, and Finances for easy thumb access
- **Global Floating Action Button (FAB)**: Positioned for easy access, provides universal entry to core actions
- **Card-Based Layout**: Information organized in digestible cards with clear visual hierarchy
- **Dashboard Widgets**: Quick overview and access to key information without deep navigation
- **Responsive Touch Targets**: All interactive elements optimized for mobile interaction
- **Contextual Actions**: Actions available where they make most sense in the user's workflow

## Accessibility Considerations

- **Color Contrast**: Ensure text is readable against backgrounds
- **Touch Targets**: Adequately sized buttons and interactive elements (minimum 44x44px)
- **Alternative Text**: For all images and icons
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Support for non-touch interaction

## Responsive Layout Strategy

- **Mobile-First**: Design for mobile experience first, then enhance for larger screens
- **Breakpoints**: Define key screen size breakpoints for adaptation
- **Content Priority**: Determine which content/features to prioritize at each screen size
- **Consistent Components**: Maintain consistent UI components across device sizes

## Next Steps

1. Create wireframes for the key screens identified in the navigation structure
2. Develop the visual design language (detailed UI components)
3. Design specific user flows for each of the primary workflows
