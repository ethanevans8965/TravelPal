# TravelPal UI/UX Design Principles

## Design Philosophy

TravelPal aims to be a *travel companion*, not just a budget tool. The design should reflect this by being:

* **Approachable**: Friendly, non-intimidating, even for users unfamiliar with budgeting
* **Efficient**: Allow quick entry and retrieval of information, especially during travel
* **Supportive**: Provide guidance without being judgmental about spending
* **Trustworthy**: Present financial information clearly and accurately

## User Experience Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with the most important information and actions, with details available on demand.
2. **Guided Interaction**: Lead users through complex processes step-by-step.
3. **Contextual Help**: Provide explanations and tips where users might need them.
4. **Forgiving Design**: Make it easy to undo actions and correct mistakes.
5. **Responsive Feedback**: Confirm user actions and show progress for longer operations.

## Visual Design Elements

### Color Palette

* **Primary Color**: A vibrant, travel-inspired color (e.g., teal blue #057B8C) for the main brand identity
* **Secondary Color**: A complementary color (e.g., coral #F27A5E) for accents and calls-to-action
* **Neutral Colors**: Light grays for backgrounds, darker grays for text
* **Functional Colors**: Green for positive indicators (under budget), amber for warnings, red for alerts (over budget)

### Typography

* **Primary Font**: A clean, modern, highly readable sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Roboto)
* **Text Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, subheadings, body text, and captions
* **Number Display**: Monospaced for financial figures to aid readability and comparison

### UI Components

* **Cards**: To contain related information about trips, budgets, or expense groupings
* **Progress Indicators**: Visual representations of budget usage and spending trends
* **Form Elements**: Simplified, streamlined inputs with clear validation
* **Lists**: For displaying transactions and historical data in a scannable format

## Navigation Structure

### Primary Navigation

* **Home/Dashboard**: Overview of current trips, recent expenses, and quick access to main functions
* **Trips**: List of all trips (past, current, upcoming) with planning status
* **Budget Planning**: Access to create and modify budget plans
* **Expense Tracking**: Record and review expenses
* **Reports**: Detailed analysis and visualization of budget vs. actual spending
* **Settings**: User preferences, currency settings, etc.

### Trip Context Navigation

Once a user selects a specific trip:

* **Trip Overview**: Summary information about the selected trip
* **Budget Plan**: Detailed budget allocation for the trip
* **Expenses**: List of recorded expenses for this trip
* **Analysis**: Comparisons of planned vs. actual spending
* **Trip Settings**: Trip-specific preferences and details

## Interaction Patterns

### Primary Workflows

1. **Creating a New Trip**:
   * Trigger → Enter basic info → Select budgeting scenario → Create budget → Review/Confirm

2. **Recording an Expense**:
   * Trigger → Select trip → Enter expense details → Categorize → Save → View updated totals

3. **Checking Budget Status**:
   * Select trip → View overview → Explore category details if needed

### Mobile Considerations

* **Bottom Navigation**: Place primary navigation at the bottom for easy thumb access
* **Floating Action Button (FAB)**: Quick access to common actions like adding expenses
* **Collapsible Sections**: Show/hide detailed information to maximize screen space
* **Optimized Inputs**: Use appropriate mobile input types (numeric keypads for amounts, etc.)

## Accessibility Considerations

* **Color Contrast**: Ensure text is readable against backgrounds
* **Touch Targets**: Adequately sized buttons and interactive elements (minimum 44x44px)
* **Alternative Text**: For all images and icons
* **Keyboard Navigation**: Support for non-touch interaction

## Responsive Layout Strategy

* **Mobile-First**: Design for mobile experience first, then enhance for larger screens
* **Breakpoints**: Define key screen size breakpoints for adaptation
* **Content Priority**: Determine which content/features to prioritize at each screen size
* **Consistent Components**: Maintain consistent UI components across device sizes

## Next Steps

1. Create wireframes for the key screens identified in the navigation structure
2. Develop the visual design language (detailed UI components)
3. Design specific user flows for each of the primary workflows
