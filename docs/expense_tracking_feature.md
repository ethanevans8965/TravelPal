# Expense Tracking Feature Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the specifications for the Expense Tracking feature of the TravelPal application. The goal is to allow users to record, categorize, and monitor their actual expenses during a trip, comparing them against their planned budget to help them stay financially on track while traveling.

## Core Functionality

The Expense Tracking feature will enable users to:

* Record individual expenses as they occur during a trip
* Categorize expenses to match budget categories (Accommodation, Transportation, Food, Entertainment, Alcohol)
* View running totals of expenses by category and overall
* Compare actual spending against the planned budget
* Store and retrieve expense data for review during and after the trip

## Expense Recording

1. **User Input:**
   * `Associated Trip` (Selection): The user must select which planned trip this expense belongs to.
   * `Expense Category` (Selection): The user selects the category this expense falls under (Accommodation, Transportation, Food, Entertainment, Alcohol, or Other).
   * `Amount` (Number): The monetary value of the expense.
   * `Date` (Date - Default Today): When the expense occurred.
   * `Description` (String - Optional): Brief note about the expense.
   * `Currency` (Selection - Optional): If different from the trip's default currency.
   * `Photo/Receipt` (Image - Optional): Ability to attach a photo of receipt.
   * `Location` (String/Coordinates - Optional): Where the expense occurred.

2. **App Process:**
   * **Associate with Trip:** Link the expense to the selected trip.
   * **Categorize:** Assign the expense to the selected category.
   * **Currency Conversion:** If expense is in a currency different from the trip's default, provide conversion (future feature).
   * **Expense Storage:** Save the expense details to the user's trip record.
   * **Update Running Totals:** Recalculate total spent by category and overall.

3. **Output (Saving the Expense):**
   * Persist the expense data associated with the trip, including:
     * Category
     * Amount
     * Date
     * Description (if provided)
     * Receipt photo (if provided)
     * Location (if provided)

## Expense Tracking Dashboard

1. **Trip Overview:**
   * Display trip name, country, date range, and days remaining
   * Show total budget and total spent so far
   * Present the difference (remaining budget or over budget)
   * Visual progress indicator (e.g., progress bar or chart)

2. **Category Breakdown:**
   * For each budget category (Accommodation, Transportation, Food, Entertainment, Alcohol):
     * Display allocated budget amount
     * Show total spent in this category so far
     * Present the difference (remaining budget or over budget)
     * Visual indicator of spending vs. budget

3. **Expense History:**
   * Chronological list of recorded expenses
   * Ability to filter by category, date range, or amount
   * Option to edit or delete individual expense entries
   * Search functionality to find specific expenses

## Budget vs. Actual Comparison

1. **Daily Tracking:**
   * Track daily spending compared to daily budget allocation
   * Alert if daily spending exceeds daily allocation
   * Show running average of daily spending

2. **Visual Representation:**
   * Bar or pie charts comparing budget vs. actual spending by category
   * Timeline chart showing spending patterns over the duration of the trip
   * Projection of expected total based on current spending rate

## Implementation Considerations

* Ensure seamless integration with the Budget Planning feature
* Design for efficient data entry to make expense tracking quick and easy
* Consider offline functionality for areas with limited connectivity
* Implement secure data storage for financial information

## Implementation Plan

This section outlines a step-by-step approach for implementing the Expense Tracking feature:

1. **Data Models - Expense Representation:**
   * **Goal:** Define how expenses will be structured in memory and storage.
   * **Action:** Create data structures (e.g., classes, data classes) for:
     * `Expense`: To hold category, amount, date, description, receipt reference, etc.
     * `DailyExpenseSummary`: To aggregate expenses by day for daily tracking.
     * `CategoryExpenseSummary`: To aggregate expenses by category.
   * **Verification:** Ability to instantiate these models and populate them with sample data.

2. **Core Logic - Basic Expense Recording:**
   * **Goal:** Implement the logic to record, categorize, and store individual expenses.
   * **Action:** Develop functions that:
     * Validate expense inputs (ensure amount is positive, date is valid, etc.).
     * Associate the expense with a trip and category.
     * Store the expense in the data model.
     * Update running totals by category and overall.
   * **Verification:** Test the recording of various expense types and confirm they are properly stored and categorized.

3. **Core Logic - Budget Comparison:**
   * **Goal:** Compare actual expenses against the planned budget.
   * **Action:** Develop functions that:
     * Calculate total spent by category and overall.
     * Compare spent amounts against budget allocations.
     * Calculate differences (over/under budget).
     * Generate alerts for over-budget situations.
   * **Verification:** Create test scenarios with varying expense patterns and confirm correct budget comparisons.

4. **Basic Interface - Expense Entry:**
   * **Goal:** Provide a user-friendly way to input expenses.
   * **Action:** Build a minimal user interface to:
     * Select the associated trip.
     * Choose an expense category.
     * Enter the amount and date.
     * Add optional details (description, etc.).
     * Save the expense.
   * **Verification:** Manually enter various expenses and confirm they are correctly recorded.

5. **Basic Interface - Expense Dashboard:**
   * **Goal:** Display expense information and budget comparisons.
   * **Action:** Build a minimal user interface to:
     * Show trip summary information.
     * Display category-by-category expense vs. budget breakdown.
     * List recorded expenses chronologically.
     * Provide basic filtering capabilities.
   * **Verification:** Review the dashboard with test data to confirm clarity and usability.

6. **Persistence - Saving & Loading Expenses:**
   * **Goal:** Store and retrieve expense data.
   * **Action:** Implement logic to:
     * Save expenses to a persistent store (e.g., as part of the trip data or in a separate store).
     * Load previously recorded expenses for a given trip.
     * Update expense data (for editing or deleting expenses).
   * **Verification:** Record expenses, close and reopen the application, and confirm all data is preserved.

7. **Enhanced Functionality - Daily Tracking:**
   * **Goal:** Implement daily expense tracking and trend analysis.
   * **Action:** Extend the existing functionality to:
     * Group expenses by day.
     * Calculate daily spending vs. daily budget allocation.
     * Generate running averages and projections.
   * **Verification:** Test with various spending patterns and confirm daily tracking behaves as expected.

8. **Enhanced Functionality - Visual Reporting:**
   * **Goal:** Add visual representations of expense data.
   * **Action:** Implement charts and graphs to:
     * Compare budget vs. actual by category.
     * Show spending trends over time.
     * Visualize projections based on current rate.
   * **Verification:** Test with various data sets to ensure the visualizations are accurate and insightful.

9. **Optional Enhancements:**
   * **Photo Receipt Support:** Allow attaching photos to expenses.
   * **Location Tracking:** Record where expenses occurred.
   * **Currency Conversion:** Handle expenses in multiple currencies.
   * **Export Functionality:** Allow exporting expense data for external analysis.

10. **Refinements:**
    * **Goal:** Improve usability and robustness.
    * **Action:** Implement:
      * Input validation and error handling.
      * Responsive design for different device sizes.
      * Performance optimizations for large expense datasets.
      * Offline functionality considerations.
    * **Verification:** Test edge cases, performance with large datasets, and usability across devices.
